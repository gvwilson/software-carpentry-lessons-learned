Copyediting stuff:

- Used "wearying" twice within five paragraphs in section 2.3.
- Section 7, first point needs rewriting, suggest "complained about editing HTML tags and maintaining forward/backward links and glossary entries by hand."
- You need to either indent paragraphs or have space between them.

Other editor-y comments:

- In section 2.5 point 3 you need to make the connection between bikeshedding and programmers more explicit, otherwise "actually enjoy programming" is a non sequitur.
- In section 2.5 and 3.0 (and generally) you talk about teaching high-level concepts "without people noticing", or you say "we teach X but what we're actually teaching is Y" -- it seems like you're tricking people or pulling a fast one, like they're not too bright or not interested so we have to fool them into learning these ideas. Is there a nicer way to characterize the fact that it's easier to learn skills than abstract concepts, or that one learns abstract concepts in the process of learning skills?

What's missing:

Instructor management -- tracking instructors and matching them to workshops. Another thing that might fit in this document is the division of responsibilities: admin, host, instructors. And the admin tool (and other tools -- Etherpads, maybe Eventbrite?) definitely deserves a mention, as it fits into the discussion of tools and technology.

----------------------------------------

- I had to google the term "iron triangle", not something I had heard about before.

- In 1, you use indents to show quotes, I believe (the first one is at least a quote). The next ones, such as "it works too well to be worth teaching", I have trouble understanding why they are indented? I sense that they are different from the rest of the text, but I can't quite figure out what role they play.

- Under 2.6, you say that SCF's mission is to "help scientists who are programming badly to program better". I personally would replace this with "help scientists create and adapt software to their needs" instead (or something along those lines).

Last, regarding why people aren't collaboratively developing teaching materials. I have a couple of more suggestions to offer.

First, teaching is considered a private affair, as pointed out in the "Building Better Teachers " book. If you have taught based off somebody else's materials and offer back tips and tricks on them, it could in some ways be perceived (by either party) as being intrusive, as if you are trying to correct somebody.

Second, somebody teaching something is, not unjustly, considered an expert. People might hesitate to give feedback because you simply don't try to teach an expert anything (the intimidation factor is high).

Last, if somebody is to contribute, they must believe that they _have_ something to contribute. This is often more than half the battle.

Regarding these: I would say that SCF has gone a long way towards trying to build these down: teaching is not private, because we do it together, and we analyze it together afterwards (debriefing sessions), we regularly emphasize that being an expert at something is not necessarily a good thing(TM) in a teaching context, and we also do a decent job telling people that their opinion on how we do things matter, even if they are complete newbies.
